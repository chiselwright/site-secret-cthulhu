The game is available to purchase online. There are various options for you to
choose from but if you're a first time visitor you should strongly consider the
full package (v4 or later).

We are selling **at cost**. There is zero markup on sales through this site.

### <i class="far fa-dice"></i> Full Package

This is what we now consider the full version on the game. It includes the
latest artwork, and most importantly, the Chaos Deck.

### <i class="far fa-dice-five"></i> Simply Rethemed

This is the original version we produced, and is essentially Secret Hitler
rethemed.  We do not recommend you purchase this version and would nudge you
gently towards the Full Package.

### <i class="far fa-dice-one"></i> The Chaos Deck

This is a useful standalone purchase for those few people who already have a
copy of Simply Rethemed and would like to upgrade to the Full Package.

You might wish to visit [the download section](/downloads) for an updated copy
of the rulebook.
