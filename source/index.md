![Cthulhu](/assets/images/Cthulhu_symbol_JH.svg){:class="img-responsive"}

The year is unknown. The place is somewhere on Earth. In Secret Cthulhu players are attempting to stop Cthulhu devouring the planet by enacting enough Rites of Salvation to protect the planet and all that currently live on it. Watch out though, there are secret Cultists among you, and one player is possessed by Cthulhu himself. These Cultists will be doing everything in their power to pave the way for Cthulhu, and the destruction and chaos he brings with him.
