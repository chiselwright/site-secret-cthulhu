We used [Ivory Game
Maker](https://www.ivorygraphics.co.uk/gamemaker/the-complete-handbook){:target="sc-ivory"}
to produce physical copies of the game.  These are the files we uploaded to
their service for printing. As we're not in this for the money, we thought we
might as well share the final results.
